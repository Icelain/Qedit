KNOWN ISSSUES-
1. If you open the font color tab and close it without changing the font color, the font color defaults to black.
2. Similar issue to the first one, if you change the font color and clear all text on the screen the font color defaults to black.(Added temporary fix: color now defaults to white)
3. UI is not flexible and the application cannot be resized.
